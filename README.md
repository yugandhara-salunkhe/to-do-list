# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple, responsive to-do list built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to add, complete, edit, and delete tasks 
with real-time progress tracking and localStorage support for data persistence.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks** – Create new tasks with a single click
- ✏️ **Edit Tasks** – Click the edit icon to modify a task
- ❌ **Delete Tasks** – Remove tasks using the delete icon
- 📦 **LocalStorage** – Tasks persist even after page reload
- 📊 **Progress Tracker** – See how many tasks are completed
- 🎉 **Confetti Effect** – Celebrate when all tasks are completed
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates** – UI reflects task changes instantly

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- [Canvas Confetti](https://confetti.js.org/more.html) (for celebration effect)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are stored as objects in an array, e.g.:
  { text: "Buy groceries", completed: false }
  
## Folder Structure
